# Georgia Tech Marketplace 
Group project for CS 4675 @ GT

### Our Motivation
Georgia Tech Marketplace is a web app for Georgia Tech students looking to sell or buy items.
Thousands of students move in and out of Georgia Tech every year and alongside them, commonplace goods and items for college living. 
The problem is that many students do not want to spend a lot of money buying new items from stores that they are not sure they will use for longer than a year or semester. 
This leads to using platforms like Facebook marketplace, Ebay, or Craigslist, which often have scams or have other credibility and safety concerns. 

We aim to address the lack of a safe platform for buying and selling items within the Georgia Tech community through the Georgia Tech Marketplace. 
This web allows students of Georgia Tech to sell used goods or offer monetary services within the GT community.

⚠️ This web application can only be used with an official GT email (@gatech.edu). ⚠️<br />
⚠️ Currently working on setting up demo users ⚠️
